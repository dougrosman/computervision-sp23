So how should this repo actually be organized? and the notion, and the p5.js editor


First off, redundancy

The sketches need to exist in the repo and in p5.js

info about the sketches needs to exist in the repo and in the notion

there are two types of sketches: basic examples, and weekly in-class sketches. I think I've been going about this all wrong. The examples should be one-and-done, used as starters for sketches in class or outside of class.

I think the libraries folder should keep all versions of the libs, old and new versions. Each sketch should the necessary library files inside the folders. this way, we know that the versions work, and new versions of libs don't introduce breaking changes

Each week's folder should have a readme file, with a brief summary of the code for that day
